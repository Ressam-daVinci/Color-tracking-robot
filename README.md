# Color Tracking Robot  

A robot capable of tracking colors using image processing. This system detects objects based on their color, processes the image data, and enables the robot to follow the detected object.  

## Project Overview  

The robot utilizes image processing techniques to identify and track objects of a specific color. The system detects the object's position, processes morphological operations to enhance detection accuracy, and controls the robot accordingly.
